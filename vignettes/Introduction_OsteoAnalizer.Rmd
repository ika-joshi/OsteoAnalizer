## Introduction
**OsteoAnalizer** is a R package with the aim to clean CSV data sets containing information 
related to Osteoarthritis. The function __*cleanCSVFile*__ cleans and organizes 
a CSV file into 4 columns: fluid levels, cartilage thickness, patient age and severity levels. The function __*makeBox*__ visualizes the fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age against severity levels using 3 box plots. The function __*makeScatter*__ visualizes the relation between any two variables from fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age by using scatter plots. 


**This document gives an overview of the functionalities associated with OsteoAnalizer **. It was written in R Markdown, using the [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) package for production. 

See `help(package = "OsteoAnalizer")` for further details and references provided by `citation("OsteoAnalizer")`. 

To download **OsteoAnalizer**, use the following commands:
``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ika-joshi/OsteoAnalizer", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("OsteoAnalizer")
```

To list all functions available in the package:
``` r
lsf.str("package:OsteoAnalizer")
```

To list all sample data available in the package:
``` r
data(package = "OsteoAnalizer")
```

## Quick Tutorial
Use provided mock CSV data to have a quick understanding of the functionalities of this package.

### Step 1. Clean ghe data set
To use the example CSV data:
``` r
# extdata is the folder where the mock data set is present 
# example_data.csv is the name of the data set
testData <- system.file("extdata", "example_data.csv", package = "OsteoAnalizer")
```

To clean the mock CSV dataset:
``` r
result <- CleanCSVFile(testData, "fluid_levels","cartilage_thickness","severity_levels","patient_age")
```

To view the cleaned data set:
``` r
result        # Should contain no NA and should have 4 columns that represent the four variables
```

### Step 2: Bar plot approach
To view distribution of fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age against severity levels: 
``` r
box_created <- makeBox(result, "fluid_levels","cartilage_thickness","severity_levels","patient_age")
```
To view the box plots:
``` r
box_created       # Should contain 3 box plots: severity levels vs 3 variables
```

### Step 3.1: Scatter plot approach with line of regression
To view the relation between any two variables from fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age
``` r
scatter_created <- makeScatter(result, "fluid_levels","cartilage_thickness")
```
To view the scatter plots:
``` r
scatter_created     # Should contain a scatter plot with the two variables mentioned 
```

### Step 3.2: Scatter plot approach without line of regerssion
To view the relation between any two variables from fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age against without the line of regression present
``` r
scatter_created <- makeScatter(result, "fluid_levels","cartilage_thickness", FALSE)
```
To view the scatter plots:
``` r
scatter_created     # Should contain a scatter plot with the two variables mentioned and no line of regression 
```
