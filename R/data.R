#' Example dataset: Mock data set with Osteoarthritis Patient Information
#'
#' This dataset, `OA_data`, contains information about patients with Osteoarthritis.
#' The variables present in this data set are the fluid_levels,
#' cartilage_thickness, severity_levels and the patient_age. The fluid_levels represent
#' the synovial fluid found in knee joints. This is measured in milliliters. The
#' cartilage_thickness variable as described by the name is the thickness of the
#' cartilage found in the knee and is measured in millimeters.
#' The severity_levels goes from a scale from 0 (least severe) to 4
#' (most severe). This variable represents the progression of osteoarthritis
#' in that individual. And lastly, the patient_age variable depicts the age of
#' the individual. This mock dataset is created to showcase the use of
#' osteoarthritis data in conjunction to the analysis functions
#' present in this project. The data was developed with reference to the data
#' set collected from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
