# OsteoAnalizer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Description
The goal of OsteoAnalizer is to clean CSV data sets containing information 
related to Osteoarthritis. The package also aims to analyse 
the relation between the 4 key aspects of Osteoarthritis(i.e fluid levels, 
cartilage thickness, severity levels, and patient age) by outputing visual elements. 

This package aims to improve current osteoarthritis related workflows by concentrating the analysis on the four key variables(fluid levels, cartilage thickness, severity levels, and patient age). To better understand the complexities of OA, the package uses advanced visualization options, such as box plots and scatter plots, which enable comparative analyses across all four variables, a capability not available in other packages. Furthermore, this package has a key feature not found in other bioinformatics packages, which is the ability to analyze OA data without the use of images. As opposed to previous packages that analyzed image-based data in order to calculate the severity of osteoarthritis, OsteoAnalizer utilizes a CSV format data sets for analysis. 

R Version: R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin20 


```

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ika-joshi/OsteoAnalizer", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("OsteoAnalizer")
```

## Overview
A quick overview of the package

``` r
ls("package:OsteoAnalizer")
data(package = "OsteoAnalizer") 
browseVignettes("OsteoAnalizer")
```
OsteoAnalizer contains 3 functions:

cleanCSVFile cleans and organizes a CSV file into 4 columns(i.e fluid levels, 
cartilage thickness, severity levels, and patient age) which is stored in a list.

makeBox visualizes fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age against severity levels. It creates a box plot of each of the variable mentioned with severity level. 

makeScatter visualizes the relation between any two variables from fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age. It creates a scatter plot of the two chosen variable. It also takes performs linear regression analysis on the two chosen variables.

## Contributions
The package was developed by Krutika Joshi. The author used a package called 
sexDisaggregate produced by Fangyi Li to follow the general outline of an R project. 
The author coded the all the functions independently with the aid of the resources listed below:

* Package `na.omit` is used to clean datasets in `CleanCSVFile`. 

* Package `read.csv` is used to read the CSV file in `CleanCSVFile`.

* Package `ggplot2` is used to create box plots and scatter plots respectively 
in function `makeBox` and `makeScatter`. ChatGPT and R CODER was used to 
understand the syntax of the functions present in ggplot2. GeeksforGeeks and 
Holtz was used to understand to color templates in the plots. 

* Package `cowplot` is used to combine boxplots plots in function `makeBox`.
ChatGPT and Claus was used to understand the syntax of cowplot.

* Package `ggpmisc` is used to show the line of regression in `makeScatter`.
ChatGPT was used to understand the syntax of the functions present in ggpmisc.

* Package `coef` is used to compute the line of regression in `makeScatter`. 
ChatGPT was used to understand the syntax. R CODER was used to understand 
the conceptual computations.

* Package `lm` is used to compute the line of regression in `makeScatter`.
ChatGPT was used to understand the syntax. R CODER was used to 
understand the conceptual computations.
