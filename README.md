# OsteoAnalizer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Description
The goal of OsteoAnalizer is to clean CSV data sets containing information 
related to Osteoarthritis. The package also aims to analyse 
the relation between the 4 key aspects of Osteoarthritis(i.e fluid levels, 
cartilage thickness, severity levels, and patient age) by outputing visual elements. 

This package aims to improve current osteoarthritis related workflows by concentrating the analysis on the four key variables(fluid levels, cartilage thickness, severity levels, and patient age). To better understand the complexities of osteoarthritis, the package uses advanced visualization options, such as box plots and scatter plots, which enable comparative analyses across all four variables, a capability not available in other packages. Furthermore, this package has a key feature not found in other bioinformatics packages, which is the ability to analyze OA data without the use of images. As opposed to previous packages that analyzed image-based data in order to calculate the severity of osteoarthritis, OsteoAnalizer utilizes a CSV format data sets for analysis. 

R Version: R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin20

## Installation

You can install the development version of OsteoAnalizer like so:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ika-joshi/OsteoAnalizer", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("OsteoAnalizer")
```

## Overview

A quick overview of the package

``` r
ls("package:OsteoAnalizer")
data(package = "OsteoAnalizer") # optional
browseVignettes("OsteoAnalizer")
```

OsteoAnalizer contains 3 functions:

cleanCSVFile cleans and organizes a CSV file into 4 columns(i.e fluid
levels, cartilage thickness, severity levels, and patient age) which is
stored in a list.

makeBox visualizes fluid levels, cartilage thickness and patient age
against severity levels. It creates a box plot of each of the variable
mentioned with severity level.

makeScatter visualizes the relation between any two variables from fluid
levels, cartilage thickness and patient age. It creates a scatter plot
of the two chosen variable. It also takes performs linear regression
analysis on the two chosen variables.

## Contributions

The package was developed by Krutika Joshi. The author coded the all the functions independently with the aid of the resources listed below:

Function `CleanCSVFile`:
* Package `na.omit` is used to clean data sets in `CleanCSVFile`. 
* Package `read.csv` is used to read the CSV file in `CleanCSVFile`.
* Package `sexDisaggregate` and `Bates` are used to understand the error checking for CSV files.
* Author coded the cleaning of the data and outputting result.

Function `makeBox`:
* Package `ggplot2` is used to create box plots.
* `GeeksforGeeks` and `Holtz` was used to understand to color templates in the `ggplot2` plots.
* Package `sexDisaggregate` is used to understand the error checking for inputs.
* Package `cowplot` is used to combine box plots.
* `ChatGPT`, `Claus` and `Wickham` were used to understand the syntax of `cowplot` and `ggplot2`.
* Author combined the concepts listed above to code a box plot with different stylistic elements and labels.

Function `makeScatter`:
* Package `ggplot2` is used to create scatter plots.
* Package `ggpmisc` is used to show the line of regression in `makeScatter`.
* Package `coef` is used to compute the line of regression. 
* Package `sexDisaggregate` is used to understand the error checking for input.
* Package `lm` is used to compute the line of regression.
* `R CODER` was used to understand the conceptual computations involved to create a scatter plot.
* `Wickham` was used to understand the syntax of the functions present in `ggplot2`. 
* `ChatGPT` was used to understand the syntax of the functions present in `ggpmisc`, `coef` and `ggplot2`.
* Author combined the concepts listed above to code a scatter plot with different stylistic elements and labels with the line of regression.
